## 
This is a project that started for a university project to develop a multiplataform game. We started using [Marmalade Engine](https://www.madewithmarmalade.com/) focusing on the mobile plataform (Android). 

However, even though the engine was very powerful, it was too low level for our needs and we ended up just finishing the prototype of the game for our college assignment, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Milkshanks/ProjetoApe).

The game concept is based on CAPCOM's One Piece Mansion game for PSX. We felt that the game had a lot to improve and we couldn't find anything similar with this game out there. So why not make our own spiritual successor with new mechanics and plot?

Soul Proprietor Q is a revamp of our first prototype, now using [Phaser](http://phaser.io/).

## ToDo List

- [ ] Try to reuse some of our previsou code
- [x] Create the "skeleton" of the project
